# Emotion Detection from Audio and Images

This project allows you to detect emotions from both facial expressions in images and speech in audio files. It combines the power of pre-trained models for face emotion recognition and Whisper for speech-to-text transcription. The program identifies emotions in both the audio and visual inputs and provides the results to the user.

## Features

* **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Detect emotions like Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, etc., from faces in uploaded images.
* **Audio Emotion Recognition**: Extracts features from audio files and classifies emotions from the audio.
* **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribes speech from audio and detects the language.
* **Real-time User Interaction**: Upload both an image and an audio file and get real-time analysis.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.6+
* pip

### Install dependencies

Run the following commands to install all required libraries:

```bash
# Install dependencies
!pip uninstall -y whisper
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
!pip install -q keras opencv-python librosa scikit-learn moviepy transformers

# Install ffmpeg for audio processing
!sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

Additionally, you'll need to download the pre-trained emotion model for face classification. This will be handled automatically during execution.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository (optional)**:
   If you want to work with the code locally, clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/emotion-detection.git
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Download Required Models**:
   The code will automatically download the required models when it runs, including:

   * The Whisper speech recognition model
   * The FER2013 mini Xception model for facial emotion recognition

3. **Upload an Image and Audio File**:
   When the script runs, it prompts you to upload an image (JPG/PNG) and an audio file (MP3/MP4/WAV). It processes both files and returns the detected emotions.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   After installing the dependencies, simply run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python emotion_detection.py
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're working in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, execute the code block directly.

2. **Upload Files**:
   When prompted, upload an image and an audio file using the file upload interface. The program will process the files and display the following results:

   * **Facial Emotion**: The emotion detected from the face in the image (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry).
   * **Audio Emotion**: The emotion detected from the audio input.
   * **Language**: The language detected from the audio's speech.
   * **Transcript**: The transcribed text from the audio file.

### Example Output

```bash
ðŸ“¤ Upload an image (JPG/PNG) and an audio (MP3/MP4/WAV):

ðŸŽ¯ FINAL RESULTS
---------------------------
Facial Emotion   : Happy
Audio Emotion    : Angry
Language         : English
Transcript       : "I am very upset right now, and I need help!"
```

## How It Works

* **Audio Processing**:

  * The script extracts audio features from the uploaded file (MFCCs and pitch).
  * These features are passed through a machine learning model (`SVC`) trained to classify emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.
  * The Whisper model is used to transcribe the speech and detect the language.

* **Image Processing**:

  * The script uses OpenCV to detect faces in the uploaded image.
  * The facial region is passed to a pre-trained emotion classification model (`fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5`), which predicts the emotion based on the facial expression.
